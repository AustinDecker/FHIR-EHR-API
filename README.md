# FHIR EHR Rest API

## Description:
This is a demo rest api that provides endpoints for FHIR patient data. The underlying database is mongodb. This was created for linking up my mock FHIR patient data to Grafana, a visualizations front-end which is database agnostic. The goal is to display key patient data in a way that is easily visualizable.
